    <h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
    <p>This program analyzes incoming PCM data on the fly and passes the results to files. The C++ source code is available and
      should be portable to other platforms at reasonable effort. The open source library <a href="http://www.fftw.org/">FFTW</a>
      version 3.x is utilized for fast operation. <tt>Analyze</tt> is optimized to use sound devices for the A/D and D/A
      conversion. </p>
    <h3>Use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>LCR</b> measurements, e.g. frequency dependent <b>ESR of electrolytic capacitors</b>.</li>
      <li>Mearuring <b>loudspeaker response</b>.</li>
      <li>General <b>impedance</b> or <b>transfer function</b> with noise reference or in sweep mode.</li>
      <li>Measure <b>cable length</b>.</li>
      <li>Measure <b>harmonic distortion</b>.</li>
      <!--li>Messure <strong>hysteresis</strong>.</li-->
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="software"></a>Software setup</h2>
    <p><img src="images/software.svg" alt="Software setup" class="rightbox" style="width: 540px; height: 214px;"><tt>Analyze</tt> is
      just the core application without any platform dependent stuff.</p>
    <p>The recording and the playback of the PCM stream as well as some buffering, to handle real time operation, must be provided
      with <em>other platform specific tools</em> like <span style="font-family: monospace;">arecord</span>/<tt>aplay</tt> (Linux)
      or <a style="font-family: monospace;" href="http://www.ca-arnold.de/">playrec</a> (OS/2). AFAIK nothing simple like that is
      available for Windows - sorry guys, so I do not recommend that OS for this purpose.</p>
    <p><strong>It is absolutely essential to use the same sound device for input and output.</strong> <tt>Analyze</tt> makes heavy
      use of the very high time correlation of input and output samples when the A/D and D/A converters are controlled by the same
      crystal oscillator for the sampling frequency. If different devices are used results of higher frequencies will derate after
      less than one second.</p>
    <p>The graphic output is also not part of <tt>Analyze</tt>. I recommend <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">Gnuplot</a> but any
      other application that can deal with ASCII files will do the job as well.</p>
    <p>See the <a href="#scripts">example scripts</a> for suggestions for the software setup including parameter files for <tt>Analyze</tt>.</p>
    <h3>Sampling rate and sample format</h3>
    <p>In general it is a good advice to use <b>the maximum</b> native <b>sample rate</b> supported by your sound device. Only for
      audio only you might prefer 48 kHz even if you have an HD audio device. This will save some computing power and reduce the
      risk of sample drops. You definitely must avoid sample rate conversions.</p>
    <p>Independent of your hardware I recommend <b>16 bits per sample</b>. Using more usually adds no value. But it might make
      things worse because some sound devices do not perform well when choosing the maximum bit depth at the maximum sample rate.</p>
    <h3>PulseAudio</h3>
    <p>Although the entire process will work with PulseAudio in principle <em>I recommend not to use it</em>. The chance to get
      unexpected resampling artifacts or stray sounds from other applications is significantly higher with PulseAudio. You can
      simply bypass PulseAudio by choosing the appropriate sound device for <tt>arecord</tt> and <tt>aplay</tt>. Young might need
      to terminate the PulseAudio daemon by <tt>pulseaudio -k</tt> before to get the device unlocked.</p>
    <h2><a name="hardware"></a>External hardware setup</h2>
    <p>While the software setup is always basically the same the hardware varies with the desired measurements.</p>

    <h3><img src="images/impedance2.svg" class="rightbox" style="width: 364px; height: 366px;">Impedance measurement - LCR meter</h3>
    <p>For high precision impedance measurements you need 4 wire connections and high impedance differential amplifiers. And to
      drive higher current you need an additional amplifier. The latter can be almost any audio amplifier, but the differential
      probes need some electronics. Two INA105 with an TL074 as impedance converter at its inputs will do the job.</p>
    <p>Depending on the impedance to measure the reference resistor might be chosen from the range 100 mΩ to 50 kΩ roughly.</p>
    <p>I furthermore recommend a <a href="calibration.html#matrix-cal3">3 point calibration</a> with a known impedance. This will
      also compensate for the properties of the reference resistor with respect to its frequency response, e.g. because of parasitic
      inductance.<br>
      If you do so you will be able to measure really low and high impedance from about 1 mΩ up to 10 MΩ, including the reactance of
      capacitors and inductors.</p>
    <h4><img src="images/impedance1.svg" class="leftbox" style="width: 189px; height: 203px;">Poor man's impedance measurement</h4>
    <p>There is a very simple variant that requires only one external reference resistor. Of course, you get only restricted
      accuracy, but the most limiting factor is the <em>maximum output current of the sound device</em>. While old sound cards
      often had a small built-in amplifier new ones sometimes do not even have enough power to drive a 32&nbsp;Ω headphone.<br>
      You may overcome this limit by using an audio amplifier. But be careful, not all amplifiers have one terminal of the speaker
      output connected to ground. And even if so it might introduce some stray current from its power supply.</p>
    <p>Reasonable values for R<sub>ref</sub> are only between 33 Ω and 3,3 kΩ roughly.</p>
    <p>In this configuration the voltage over the reference resistor cannot be sampled directly. Only the sum with the voltage over
      the test impedance is available. You need to tell <tt>Analyze</tt> by the <a href="parameter.html#_diff"><tt>diff</tt></a>
      option to use differential sampling mode. This causes the current (denominator) to be calculated by</p>
    <blockquote>I = (Right - Left) / R<sub>ref</sub></blockquote>
    <p>I recommend to use <a href="calibration.html#matrix-cal3">3 point calibration</a> even in this simple configuration.
      Although you cannot use a 4 wire connection it will significantly improve the accuracy.</p>
    <h3><img src="images/two-port.svg" alt="wire diagram for two port network" class="rightbox" style="width: 288px; height: 172px;">
      2 port measurement - transfer function</h3>
    <p>If you two-port network can directly deal with the line level of the sound device, e.g. an audio equalizer, it can be
      directly connected like shown in the image. The only special thing needed is an Y-cable to get the reference feedback.</p>
    <h4><img src="images/speaker-response2.svg" alt="" style="width: 546px; height: 324px;" class="leftbox">Loudspeaker response</h4>
    <p>To the left is the typical setup for speaker measurements. The properties of the audio amplifier (and sound device) have no
      relevant influence on the result. <em>The microphone and its corresponding amplifier is the critical part.</em> There are
      calibration services available for these combinations at reasonable charge.</p>
    <p><b>You cannot use USB microphones</b> calibrated by the manufacturer. They use a different crystal oscillator for the
      sampling rate than the sound card used for playback of the reference. This results in slightly different speed of playback and
      recording destroying the phase coherence used by <tt>Analyze</tt> to get high precision results. At least this is untested.</p>
    <p>You should chose a sweep mode to reduce systematic errors due to harmonic distortion, intermodulation or non minimum phase
      responses.</p>
    <p>Of course, there are more things to respect to get a reasonable speaker measurement, first of all some kind of anechoic
      location. But this is by far beyond the scope of this document.<br>
      If your intention is to characterize the room and the speakers together for doing digital room correction, things are easier.</p>
    <h4><img src="images/speaker-response1.svg" alt="" class="rightbox" style="width: 489px; height: 324px;">Linear amplifier</h4>
    <p><em>If you trust your amplifier</em> to be linear or you want to compensate for its properties you can use a more simple
      setup. A sufficiently linear amplifier must satisfy the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Loudness</b> correction must be <b>disabled</b> or not existing.</li>
      <li>The <b>tone controls</b> must be <b>disabled</b> by a "direct CD" switch or something like that. Putting all controls in
        their neutral position is usually not sufficient.</li>
      <li>Any <b>bass boost</b> feature must be <b>disabled</b>.</li>
      <li>You should <b>no</b>t use a <b>Class D amplifier</b> because they tend to have deviations at high frequencies. The build
        in compensation only works correctly for a certain load impedance which typically not satisfied by your loudspeaker.<br>
        Of course, this does not count if you only want to characterize woofers e.g. for a sub-woofer crossover.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="examples"></a><a name="scripts"></a>Helper Scripts</h2>
    <p>In the <b><tt>sample</tt> folder</b> there are a bunch of scripts to set up scenarios as mentioned above. They are all
      intended to be used with Ubuntu Linux, but you may use them as blueprint for other platforms too. See <a href="examples.html">examples</a>
      for some results created by these sample files.</p>
    <p>The sample files assume that your sound card can deal with 192 kHz sampling rate (HD audio) which is quite common for modern
      PCs. If not you should adjust the sampling rate to 48 kHz and set the maximum frequency in <tt>fft.cfg</tt> to 20 kHz.</p>
    <p>All file names mentioned here are in the same directory. The analyze executable have to be build before the scrips can be
      used. The <tt>Analyze</tt> executable is expected in the parent folder. If you have chosen a different build directory you
      should put a symbolic link there.</p>
    <h3>Configuration files for <tt>Analyze</tt></h3>
    <p>The <b><tt>*.cfg</tt></b> files are configuration files for <tt>Analyze</tt>. They are only slightly platform dependent.
      The files have an inheritance hierarchy by including the parent configuration file.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b><tt>setup.cfg</tt></b> - root configuration used by <i>all</i> other configurations</p>
        <p>It sets sampling rate, sample format and other global options. Furthermore is sets up the <b>sample input/output</b> to
          the fixed names <tt>rec.pipe</tt> and <tt>play.pipe</tt> respectively. As the name suggests this should be pipes (also
          called fifos) that receive or play raw samples from or to the sound device. The script <b><tt>setup_alsa_server.sh</tt></b>
          is <b>invoked at program start</b>. It creates the pipes and spawns the <tt>arecord</tt> and <tt>aplay</tt> processes
          to feed or consume the pipe data respectively.</p>
        <p>It also writes the <b>effective configuration</b> to <b><tt>current.cfg</tt></b> which is used to extract some
          parameters for plots (<a href="parameter.html#_fmin"><tt>fmin</tt></a>, <a href="parameter.html#_fmax"><tt>fmax</tt></a>,
          <a href="parameter.html#_fftlen"><tt>fftlen</tt></a> and <a href="parameter.html#_rref"><tt>rref</tt></a>) into the file
          <tt>gpenv.gp</tt> intended to be included by Gnuplot.</p>
        <p>Last but not least the file for the (last) FFT analysis results is set to <tt>data.dat</tt>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b><tt>fft.cfg</tt></b> - configuration file for FFT based real time impedance measurements</p>
            <p>It selects an FFT length of 16,384, infinite loop mode and slightly pink noise as reference. To reduce measurement
              noise and analysis overhead it averages always 16 chunks of the FFT length before the results are passed to Gnuplot
              which should listen at <tt>stdout</tt> of <tt>analyze</tt> for plot commands. See <tt>measure.sh</tt> for an
              appropriate setup. This first command passed to Gnuplot is always <tt>l'gpenv.gp'</tt> to inject current
              configuration values into Gnuplot.</p>
            <p>The sound output is set to <a href="parameter.html#_symmout">symmetric mode</a> because my amplifier has a symmetric
              input. You need not to change that unless you rely on the same phase to be present at the left and right sound
              channel.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><b><tt>fft-.2.cfg</tt></b>, <b><tt>fft-2.cfg</tt></b>, <b><tt>fft-20.cfg</tt></b>, <b><tt>fft-200.cfg</tt></b>,
                  <b><tt>fft-2k.cfg</tt></b>, <b><tt>fft20k.cfg</tt></b> - files for selected reference resistors</p>
                <p>These files just refine a few parameters for a bunch of different reference resistors used for impedance
                  measurements. They also select the appropriate calibration file which must be named <tt>zero-<var>RRR</var>.dat</tt>.
                  <em>The calibration files must be created before the measurement can start.</em> Use the <tt>calibrate?.sh</tt>
                  scripts for this purpose.</p>
                <p>You probably need to adjust this files for your reference resistors.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b><tt>fft-<var>RRR</var>-l.cfg</tt></b> - refinement for measuring inductors<br>
                    This changes the energy distribution of the noise reference slightly to prefer lower frequencies which performs
                    better for inductive loads.</li>
                  <li><b><tt>fft-<var>RRR</var>-c.cfg</tt></b> - refinement for measuring capacitors<br>
                    This changes the energy distribution of the noise reference slightly to prefer higher frequencies which performs
                    better for capacitive loads.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b><tt>calibrate.cfg</tt></b> - calibration for impedance measurements</p>
            <p>This instructs Analyze to perform a <a href="calibration.html#matrix-cal">matrix calibration</a> and write the result
              to the file <tt>zero.dat</tt>. <em>You need to rename the resulting file matching the used reference resistor</em>
              once the calibration has completed successfully.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b><tt>calibrate2.cfg</tt></b> - perform 2 point calibration<br>
                Perform a (simple) calibration with impedance 0 (short cut) and impedance ∞ (open).</li>
              <li><b><tt>calibrate3.cfg</tt></b> - perform 3 point calibration<br>
                Perform a full calibration with impedance 1 (a resistor ideally identical to the reference resistor), impedance ∞
                (open) and 0 (short cut).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b><tt>room.cfg</tt></b> - record the loudspeaker response in the room<br>
              Currently not well tested.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b><tt>roomscan.cfg</tt></b> - fast scan of the loudspeaker response in the current room</p>
            <p>This activates <a href="parameter.html#_stereo">two channel mode</a> to record the response of both stereo channels at
              the same time. The scan is done with an FFT length of 65,536 in the range 20 Hz ... 20 kHz. Only frequencies separated
              approximately by halftone are used for analysis. You will not be able to extract reasonable values for the group delay
              with this coarse pattern. Furthermore some the frequencies of the 2nd and 3rd harmonic are unused to get a rough idea
              of distortion.</p>
            <p>A sampling rate of 48 kHz is recommended for this type of measurement. Higher frequencies just add overhead and
              reduce accuracy.</p>
            <p>Every 4 cycles of FFT length the result file <tt>data.dat</tt> is updated. The <tt>stdout</tt> of <tt>analyze</tt>
              is intended to be piped to Gnuplot. See <tt>measure.sh</tt> for an appropriate setup. This first command passed to
              Gnuplot is always <tt>l'gpenv.gp'</tt> to inject current configuration values into Gnuplot. Each time an FFT
              completed <tt>l'viewH.gp'</tt> is sent to Gnuplot to view the transfer function.</p>
            <p>All measurement data since start is aggregated to get less noisy results. The longer you run the more precise you
              get. But due to systematic errors like non minimum phase system or intermodulation you will not get high accuracy.
              Simply stop when the result becomes stable.</p>

    <h3>Shell scripts</h3>
    <p>The <b><tt>*.sh</tt></b> scripts are intended for Bash.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><b><tt>measure.sh</tt></b> - invoke one of the above configuration files</dt>

        <p>This script is intended for all measurements except for calibration. Use <b><tt>./measure @<var>filename</var>.cfg</tt></b>
          with the appropriate configuration file name to start a measurement.</p>
        <p>You can also pass additional command line parameters to <tt>Analyze</tt>. In fact <tt>@<var>filename</var>.cfg</tt> is
          also just an include directive for <tt>Analyze</tt>.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b><tt>calibrate2.sh</tt></b>, <b><tt>calibrate3.sh</tt></b> - perform <a href="calibration.html#matrix-cal">2 point or 3

      <dd>
        <p>Just start the script and follow the instructions. The result is shown with Gnuplot after completion. Whenever possible
          you should prefer the 3 point calibration.<br>
          After the calibration completed you probably want to copy the result file <tt>zero.dat</tt> to a more descriptive file
          name matching your current setup. These files are also included by the impedance measurement configuration files.</p>

        <p>After calibration a second verification step is recommended. It performs the same calibration but with the previously
          perfromed calibration result in <tt>zero.dat</tt> applied. The result is now written to <tt>zeroD.dat</tt>. At this
          point you should see a significantly improved result.</p>

          if you use the sample configuration files above.</p>
        <p>The setup also passes the content of the file <tt>mixer.in</tt> to <tt>amixer</tt>. You should use this to set defined
          mixer levels.</p>
        <p><em>You likely need to adjust this file</em> matching your sound hardware.</p>
